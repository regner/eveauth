Description: # eveauth
        A simple library for verifying authorization tokens provided against the EVE
        Online SSO. Helper methods and decorators are provided for simplysimplifying the
        ability to restrict access based on scopes or a character ID.
        
        ## Using
        ```python
        
        from eveauth import authenticate
        
        # Just get the token information back
        token = authenticate(request)
        
        # Require a specific scope
        token = authenticate(request, ['character'])
        
        # By default using the authenticate method directly will raise either a
        # ccpauth.Unauthorized or ccpauth.Forbidden exception if something goes wrong or
        # missing a scope.
        
        # Decorate a flask view
        from ccpauth.contrib.flask import authenticate
        
        @authenticate()
        @app.route('/v1/<int:character_id>/')
        def get_char_stats(character_id):
            if request.token['character_id'] != character_id:
                abort(403)
        
        # The flask decorator will abort with a 401 or 403 if the ccpauth package raises
        # one if its exceptions. You only need to handle making sure the character the
        # token is for is allowed the resource they are requesting.
        ```
